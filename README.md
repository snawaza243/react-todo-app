React functional component based 'ToDo' App 

Sure, I can help you with that. Here's an example of what your `README.md` file could look like:

# ToDo App

This is a simple to-do list app built using React and related technologies. It allows users to add, rename, and delete items, as well as delete all items at once. The added items are saved locally and stored separately for each user.

## Installation

To install the app, simply clone this repository and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the app, run `npm start`. This will open the app in your default browser.

```bash
npm start
```

## Features

- Add items: Users can add new items to their to-do list by typing in the input field and pressing Enter.

- Rename items: Users can rename an item by clicking on it, editing the text, and pressing Enter.

- Delete items: Users can delete an item by clicking on the X icon next to it.

- Delete all items: Users can delete all items at once by clicking on the "Clear All" button.

- Local storage: The added items are saved locally and stored separately for each user.

## Future improvements

Here are some ideas for future improvements to the app:

- Prioritize tasks: Allow users to prioritize their tasks by adding tags or labels.

- Set duedates: Allow users to set due dates for their tasks and receive reminders.

- Categorize tasks: Allow users to categorize their tasks into different groups or projects.

- Cloud-based storage: Integrate the app with a cloud-based storage service, such as Google Drive or Dropbox, to allow users to access their to-do lists from multiple devices.
